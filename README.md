A cold wallet for Nano.

## To-Do
  1. Clean up JS, it's all over the place. Combine into one <script> tag, except the libraries.
  2. Add JS that sets the image. Right now there are three identical base64 images.
  3. Add support for broadcasting state/recieve blocks.
  4. Add client side validation.
  5. Make proper UI.
